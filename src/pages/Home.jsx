          Constantly in flux; shifting, distorting, always reborn as something worse. Destruction by ecological catastrophes, the fallout of history's belligerence; by modern man-made Miseries or the blood spilled by the reckless machine of capitalist supremacy. Mankind's greatest ability truly is to destroy itself in creative ways. Designer demise, consumer-customized death, endlessly on repeat.

          Poisonous space rocks, nuclear weapons, cyclical revolutions, warring nations, warring corporations, warring neighbors; pandemics, tsunamis, volcanoes. In between it all: direct person-machine interfaces, tactical neural implants, and bacteria from outer space intercellular nanorobotics. And the sky is full of ads.

            The shallow levels of the Net are accessible to anyone with an RCD. Social feeds, corporate storefronts, entertainment streams, government propaganda—a constant barrage of sensory input that most people can't imagine living without.
