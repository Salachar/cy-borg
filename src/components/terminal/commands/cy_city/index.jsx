        Pre-Incident ruins tower over post-Incident brutalism. Corporate glass reflects slum fires.
        The rich ascend into climate-controlled penthouses while the poor drown in nanomold-infested basements.
        It's a vertical hierarchy made literal: the higher you live, the longer you survive.
        The city consumes everything - hope, humanity, history - and excretes chrome, concrete, and corpses.
        Welcome to Cy. You were born here. You'll die here. There is no escape."
